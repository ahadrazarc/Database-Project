# Welcome to the  Project Repository

Greetings! This repository is dedicated to the development of the Brother project, a comprehensive initiative that involves creating a website integrated with a backend database. The primary focus of this project is to facilitate and enhance the CCP Report Open Ended Lab processes.

## Project Overview

### Website Development

The project involves the creation of a user-centric website, acting as the primary interface for the CCP Report Open Ended Lab. This website aims to streamline data input, retrieval, and visualization, providing an intuitive platform for users.

### Backend Database

At the core of our project lies the backend database. This critical component is designed to efficiently store and manage data collected during lab activities. The database architecture is tailored to meet the specific needs of the CCP Report Open Ended Lab, ensuring optimal performance and reliability.

## Project Objectives

1. **Efficient Data Management:** Develop a robust backend database system to efficiently manage and organize data related to lab activities.

2. **User-Friendly Interface:** Create an intuitive and responsive website interface to enable seamless interaction with the database.

3. **Comprehensive Reporting:** Implement features for generating detailed CCP reports based on the data stored in the database.

4. **Open-Ended Lab Support:** Customize the system to accommodate the unique requirements of the Open-Ended Lab, ensuring flexibility and adaptability.


2. **Set Up Dependencies:**
   Configure the necessary dependencies for both the website and the backend database.

3. **Database Configuration:**
   Set up database connection parameters in the relevant configuration files.

4. **Local Deployment:**
   Run the website locally to start interacting with the database.
